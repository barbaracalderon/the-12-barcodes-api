				<h3 class="major">What is a barcode?</h3>
				<p>
					A barcode is a machine-readable representation of data in a visual format. It consists of a series
					of parallel lines or geometric patterns arranged in a specific way, with each pattern representing a
					different alphanumeric character or set of characters. Barcodes are widely used in various
					industries for purposes such as inventory tracking, product identification, and asset management.
				</p>
				<p>
					They are used for a wide range of applications accross various industries. Here are three examples.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Easy checkout</strong>: When you're ready to buy something, the cashier just scans the
					barcode with a machine. That machine reads the barcode's secret code, which tells it things like
					what the item is and how much it costs. This makes checking out super fast and helps stores keep
					track of what they're selling.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Tracking Shipments</strong>: Ever wonder how your package magically finds its way to your
					doorstep after you order it online? Well, barcodes are part of the magic! When your package is sent
					out, it gets a special barcode label. As it travels from the warehouse to the delivery truck to your
					house, scanners read the barcode and keep tabs on where it's going. So, barcodes help companies make
					sure your package gets to you safe and sound.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Inventory Management</strong>: Think about how many books a big bookstore or library has â€“
					tons, right? Barcodes help keep track of all those books! Every time a new batch of books arrives at
					the bookstore or library, they're scanned with a barcode scanner. That way, the store or library
					knows exactly which books they have and where they are. It helps them keep their shelves organized
					and make sure they always have the books people want.
				</p>
				<h3 class="major">Different Types</h3>
				<p>
					There are many types of barcodes, each designed for specific applications and requirements. The
					reason for the variety of barcode types lies in the diverse requirements of different industries,
					applications, geographic location and different encoding schemes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some barcodes are optimized for high-speed scanning in retail environments, while
					others are designed to encode large amounts of data in limited space. Additionally, certain barcode
					types offer enhanced error detection and correction capabilities, making them suitable for
					applications where data integrity is critical.
				</p>
				<p>
					Overall, the wide range of barcode types allows businesses and organizations to choose the most
					suitable barcode format for their specific needs, ensuring efficient and accurate data capture in
					various contexts.
				</p>
				<h3 class="major">Legacy and international efforts</h3>
				<p>
					Different regions and industries often have specific requirements or preferences for the types of
					barcodes they use. This can be influenced by a few different factors:
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Legacy Systems</strong>: Some industries may already have established systems in place for
					handling certain types of barcodes. These systems might have been developed years ago and are still
					in use today because they work well and are familiar to the industry.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Regulatory Standards</strong>: Certain industries or regions might have regulations or
					standards that dictate which types of barcodes they need to use. These standards ensure consistency
					and accuracy in data collection and processing.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Regional Conventions</strong>: ometimes, certain types of barcodes are just more popularfor
					commonly used in specific geographic regions. This could be due to historical reasons, industry
					preferences, or simply because it's what everyone in that area is used to. For example, in the
					United States, UPC barcodes are commonly used in retail environments, while EAN
					barcodes are more common in Europe. These differences can be traced back to historical adoption
					patterns and industry preferences.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are indeed international efforts to standardize barcodes across different regions, languages,
					and systems. <strong>This initiative has several key drivers, with globalization being a major
						one.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					It's worth noting that while there are standardized barcode systems like UPC/EAN and GS1, different
					regions and industries may have specific variations or additional data encoded within the standard
					format to cater to their specific needs.
				</p>

			<!-- About -->
			<article id="about">
				<h2 class="major">About the Project</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="static/images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>
					Greetings, and welcome to the <strong>12 Barcodes API project.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm Barbara Calderon, a software developer from Brazil who
					recently graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems. This project represents
					another step in my journey to enhance my skills and understanding of web development.
				</p>
				<p>
					Crafted with a focus on (honestly) educating myself a bit more, this RESTful API serves as a
					playground
					to explore and master technologies from the Flask ecosystem and some software design. Embracing the
					<strong>Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture</strong> and <strong>DRY principle</strong>, I
					strive for a clean, organized codebase that fosters <strong>maintainability and scalability</strong>
					- in the rare chance this project ever grows to something unexpected.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here, you'll find only two HTTP methods: POST and GET.
				</p>
				<p>
					With POST, you can send data to encode and receive the corresponding barcode image for the specified
					endpoint. Meanwhile, GET returns a JSON response containing information about the barcode associated
					with your requested endpoint. The key here is <strong>simplicity and practicality.</strong> More on
					this in the Swagger tab in the main page.
				</p>
				<p>
					To ensure clarity and ease of use, I've meticulously documented this project according to the
					<strong>OpenAPI standard with Swagger</strong>. Drawing inspiration from <strong>HTML5UP</strong>
					templates, I've added my personal touch to the landing page design, making tweaks for a customized
					look and feel. Check them out, they're great. Additionally, the project features stunning imagery
					sourced from <strong>Unsplash</strong>, adding visual appeal and personality.
				</p>
				<p>
					One unique aspect of this project is its reliance on <strong>lightweight data processing</strong>,
					foregoing the need for a traditional database. To achieve this, I crafted a buffer to handle images
					so it deals with image data directly in memory, avoiding the need to write it down. This may impact
					latency since the images are served without the need for a retrieval move. No need for a persistent
					storage.
				</p>
				<p>
					This decision reflects my commitment to simplicity. You need a barcode image, <strong>you get
						it</strong>. You need a little bit of information for that type of barcode, <strong>you get
						it</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've chosen to deploy this project on the <strong>Render</strong> platform, one, because they have a
					free service and two, their reliability for users like you. With Render's robust infrastructure and
					seamless deployment process, I can focus on delivering a polished and reliable API experience.
					Because it is deployed on a free server, it may take a while to start the engines the first time.
					Please, keep this in mind when you visit this URL.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lastly, this project is hosted in a <strong>Github</strong> repository. If code is something that
					interests you, go check it out.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now it's time to plug the machines.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thank you for dropping by.
				</p>

			<!-- Swagger -->
			<article id="swagger">
				<h2 class="major">Swagger</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="static/images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<h3 class="major">Swagger-UI</h3>
				<p>Check the documentation at <a href="https://the-12-barcodes-api.onrender.com/swagger-ui"
						target="_blank">"/swagger-ui"</a>, a user-friendly
					interface generated by Swagger/OpenAPI tools that allows developers and users to interact with and
					explore an API <strong>directly from the web browser</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are a <strong>developer</strong>, you can automate requests to get the data you want. If you
					are a <strong>browser user</strong>, you can manually retrieve the data you want through mouse
					clicks and save in your machine. A step-by-step guide is below.
				</p>
				<h3 class="major">Endpoints and methods</h3>
				<p>
					The 12 BARCODES API has the following endpoints:
				</p>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>/code-128</li>
					<li>/code-39</li>
					<li>/ean-8</li>
					<li>/ean-13</li>
					<li>/ean-14</li>
					<li>/pzn7</li>
					<li>/jan</li>
					<li>/issn</li>
					<li>/isbn-10</li>
					<li>/isbn-13</li>
					<li>/upc-a</li>
					<li>/gs1-128</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					For each endpoint, there are two HTTP methods available to make a request: they are
					<strong>POST</strong> and
					<strong>GET</strong>.
				</p>
				<div id="image-swagger">
					<p>
						The first one will send you the barcode image as response:
					</p>
					<p>
						<img src="static/images/barcode_upc_a.png" alt="Example barcode for upc-a" width="350">
					</p>
					<p>
						The second one will send you a json with some information about the barcode:
					</p>
					<p>
						<img src="static/images/upca_json.png" alt="Json file containing upc-a information" width="550">
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3 class="major">Browser User</h3>
				<p>If you are browsing this API from the browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, etc), you can generate
					the barcode images and download them in your machine. It's simple:
				</p>
				<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Go to the "/swagger-ui" mentioned in the first paragraph</li>
					<li>Choose the barcode of your preference</li>
					<li>Click the green button for POST method</li>
					<li>It will open an input space that contains a JSON (brackets <strong>{ }</strong>)</li>
					<li>In the JSON, type the data you want to encode instead of the name "string"</li>
					<li>(Make sure the data is valid for that type of barcode or else it will generate an error)</li>
					<li>Click the EXECUTE button</li>
					<li>The image is generated and ready for download in a blue link below</li>
					<li>Download the image</li>
					<li>Done</li>
				</ol>
				</p>

				<h3 class="major">Educational Purposes</h2>
					<p>
						This API relies on free resources as it was made for small-scale requests to a synchronous
						server. This is because it was intended to serve as a personal educational project to improve
						coding skills. I crafted the idea and built it on my own. So I kindly ask you to be patient
						about it if you encounter something odd.
					</p>
					<p>
						I harvested valuable knowledge from coding this on my own and doing research. I learned a lot
						and choose to keep it open and public for anyone interested in checking out the code and the
						overall system.
					</p>
					<p>
						Best regards,
					</p>
					<p>
